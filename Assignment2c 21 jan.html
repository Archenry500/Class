    <h2 id="top">Lepidoptera butterflies and moths</h2>
    The Lepidoptera order includes <ins> moths</ins> and <ins>butterflies</ins>, and there are 2,000 native species in New Zealand. Moths are usually active during the night and are usually less colourful than butterflies, but there are exceptions. The Ahi Pepe MothNet project is working to raise the profile of moths with the public.If you have ever caught a moth or butterfly in your hand, you might have found a light powder on your hands afterwards. These are the tiny scales that give the group its name, from the Greek <mark>lepis</mark> (scale) + <mark>pteron</mark> (wing).</p> <br>

     <h2>Diptera flies</h2>
     We usually think of flies as pests, but they are hugely important for pollination and breaking down rotting material. Most insects have two pairs of wings, but in some cases, one pair will be modified to perform another function. In flies, their second pair of wings are reduced into something called halteres, which act as a balance and guiding system and is one of the reasons why it can be so hard to swat flies. Because of these halteres, flies have only two wings, which is what their order name Diptera is based on, from the Greek <ins>di</ins> (two) + <ins>pteron</ins> (wing). <br>

        <h2>Hemiptera cicadas and true bugs</h2>
        Hemiptera means half-wing and comes from the Greek <mark>hemi</mark> (half) + <mark>pteron</mark> (wing). This is because the first pair of wings is hardened at the base while part of the wing is thin and membranous. Entomologists refer to insects in this order as bugs, although the word can also be used to refer to insects in general. The members of this order can look very different, but all members have piercing mouthparts used to suck up fluids, usually from plants, but sometimes from inside other insects! <br>
