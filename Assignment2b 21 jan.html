    <h2 id="top">Taxonomy of insects</h2> <br>
    <p>
        Organisms are sorted into nested groups based on evolutionary relationships and physical characteristics. Insects are animals and therefore fit into the larger grouping or kingdom called Animalia. They have segmented bodies and an exoskeleton, which makes them part of the phylum Arthropoda along with crustaceans. Insects are categorised under the class Insecta. There are 29 major insect orders but the five most diverse insect orders are:
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Coleoptera :</h3>       beetles</li>
            <li><h3>Hymenoptera :</h3>      ants, wasps and bees</li>
            <li><h3>Lepidoptera :</h3>      butterflies and moths</li>
            <li><h3>Diptera :</h3>          flies</li>
            <li><h3>Hemiptera:</h3>        cicadas and true_bugs</li>
        </ul> <br>

        <h2>Coleoptera beetle</h2>
        Beetles are known as Coleoptera, from the Greek <mark>koleos</mark> (sheath) + <mark> pteron</mark> (wing). This refers to how their first pair of wings have hardened into an elytra that covers the second pair of wings (and usually the entire abdomen) as a protective case. <br>

        Ladybirds (from the Coleoptera order) are an invasive species. Originally from eastern Asia, they are now spread throughout New Zealand and are often regarded as a pest. Ladybirds eat other insects, including scale insects and the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, and they also consume pollen, nectar, fruit juices and honeydew. A female ladybird lays around 1,000â€“2,000 eggs in her lifetime.

        <h2>Hymenoptera ants, wasps and bees</h2>
        The Hymenoptera order includes ants, wasps and bees and is one of the most morphologically and ecologically diverse insect orders worldwide. Some of the members of this order are hugely important as pollinators, predators or pests. In this group, the front and hind wings are locked together by a tiny row of hooks (male and queen ants have wings). It is a little unclear why they are called <mark>Hymenoptera</mark>, from the Greek <ins>humen</ins> (membrane) + <ins>pteron</ins> (wing). <br>
