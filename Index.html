        <h3 id="Text1"><b> What is an insect?</b></h3>
        Insects are animals that have six legs, three body sections (a head, a thorax and an abdomen), <ins>antennae</ins> and a hard <ins>exoskeleton</ins>, like a skeleton on the outside of their body, they are <ins>invertebrates</ins>. <ins>Vertebrates</ins> like mammals have a skeleton on the inside of their body. Insects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, meaning that they have the largest number of species. <br>

        <h3 id="Text2"><b> Life cycle</b></h3>
        Insects lay eggs, which hatch to produce a <mark>larva</mark>. These larvae shed their exoskeleton several times until they reach adulthood. Some insects change slightly between each moult and are called <mark>nymphs</mark> during the process, for example, cockroaches and water boatmen, while some undergo a massive change in their final moult, like butterflies, which have an extra <mark>pupa</mark> phase. An insect that is not an adult or not mature is broadly called a <mark>juvenile</mark>. <br>

        <h3 id="Text3">Taxonomy of insects</h3>
        There are more than 20,000 species of insects found in New Zealand. They vary widely in shape and size, but most belong to only five groups or orders. Insects in an order can look very different, but they all share important similarities.
        It is important to be able to identify different species of insects. With the large number of insect species in the world, it is critical to have a system for organising them. <mark>Taxonomy</mark> (from the Greek <mark>taxon</mark> meaning arrangement) is the science responsible for this. Taxonomists are scientists concerned with organising living things into different groups and figuring out how those groups relate to one another. Classification involves grouping organisms into a series of hierarchical categories: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. These categories were first developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century and have remained in common use ever since. <br>
